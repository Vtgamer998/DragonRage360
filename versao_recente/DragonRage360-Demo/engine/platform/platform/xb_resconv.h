 * Resource endianness for the Xbox 360 build.
 *
 * The files on the disc are PS2 data: little-endian. The game reads them with native loads, and the Xbox 360 is
 * big-endian, so every multi-byte field of every file the game reads has to be converted before the game looks at
 * it. This module is the PLACE where that happens, not the conversions themselves: the formats of most files are
 * not known (docs/systems/graphics.md of the repository: "The model and texture formats are not understood yet").
 * What it does:
 *
 *   1. After each whole-file read from the disc (xb_plat_file.c, gXbFilePostRead) it finds the converter
 *      registered for that file's id and runs it on the buffer.
 *   2. For files the game stores BPE-packed (Bpe_Decode), the converter must run on the UNPACKED bytes, which exist
 *      only inside the game's own code. The packed bytes are endian-neutral except the 8-byte header. So for a
 *      packed file the read only remembers "this buffer is file id N"; src/sys/bpe.c (patch in patches/) reads its
 *      header as little-endian and calls XbRes_AfterBpe(src, out, size) at the end, which runs the converter on the
 *      output.
 *   3. Every file that is read with NO converter registered is logged once with its id: the first run of the game
 *      on the console writes the real list of what still has to be done to default.log (XbRes_Report prints a
 *      summary).
 *
 * File ids are the game's global ids (docs/systems/files_and_assets.md): <= 0 pzs3us0.afs, 1..0xD47 pzs3us1.afs
 * (id = index + 1), >= 0xD48 pzs3us2.afs (id = index + 0xD48).
